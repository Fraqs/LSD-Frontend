##  Setup

> If the contract isn't installed add it with yarn.
  
```bash
# bash
yarn add Fraqs/LSD-Project.Contract
```
  
##  Usage
  
  
###  Testing
  
  
The test is handled by the test framework Jest.
  
```bash
# bash
yarn test
```
  
###  Development
  
  
The development environment uses a mock/ fake Contract. This is used when the backend isn't connected to the frontend.
  
```bash
# bash
yarn dev
```
  
###  Production
  
  
The production environment uses the RPC Contract. This is used when the backend is connected to the frontend.
  
```bash
# bash
yarn start
```
